## Wiki
There is a [wiki](https://github.com/samfun123/KtaneTwitchPlays/wiki) for this project, which covers all of the steps of how to setup *TP:KTaNE* and goes through all of the commands available to Twitch Chat.

## To-do List
### Phase 1
These are features that are absolutely required in order to allow Twitch Plays to run completely remotely.
- [x] Control vanilla modules directly with `!x` commands.
- [x] Control bomb orientation and held status with `!bomb` commands.
- [x] Control post-game screen with `!continue`, `!retry`, and `!back` commands.
- [x] Control pre-game screen with `!binder` and `!freeplay` commands.
- [x] Add response messages to improve interaction with Twitch Chat.
- [x] Add leaderboard/blame UI to post-game screen to add further interaction with Twitch Chat.
### Phase 2
These are the next 'nice-to-have' features, once all of the phase 1 tasks are completed and tested to function well.
- [x] Add robust support for mod bomb casings and multiple bombs.
- [x] Control mod modules directly.
- [ ] *'Democracy / Anarchy' and or other moderation control?*
- [ ] *Command limiting? (depending on popularity of streams)*
